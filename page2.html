            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>&nbsp;Stray dogs have always been a problem in the community. Dogs are pets and should be kept inside a home. They are the what we call man’s bestfriend yet most owners neglect them and leave them on the streets which is very wrong in the first place. Why would someone get a pet and then leave them like nothing when they don’t feel like having them anymore? Its just plain stupid just by thinking about it. I once had a neighbor who bought a dog because of the norm. Yes, you read that right. It was so mainstream. People posting cute and fluffy looking dogs on facebook, Instagram, twitter and other social media sites. She got a dog who looks so cute and fluffy!! Yayks kagigil!! It was a german shepherd type of dog. It was so little and its photo was all over her timeline. As days passed by, I noticed that the photos she posted has already been lessened. I also observed that she would take photo of her dogs but not really play with it. It was so saddening.
</strong><div><strong>&nbsp;A few months later, I visited their house. My mom told me to bring food because it was her birthday. It has always been like that. If you can give something then go. Some of our neighbors sometimes give us food and when there are balikbayans we would get chocolates. Yay again. Going back, I was in their home and it was quiet. I didn’t hear their dog barking. Maybe it was asleep or whatever. Maybe the dog knows me already that is why it doesn’t bark on me. I went home and the next days and months, I haven’t heard nor see the shadow of the dog. As I was walking on the way to ride a jeepney, I saw the dog, its her dog.
</strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;I knew it was the dog because of the collar. I called her but no answer so I went directly on her house. She said the dog went out on his own but I really think she is lying. If her dog run out or someone stole it opr if it went missing, she should’ve looked for it but it seems like she doesn’t really care at all. She abandoned it and left it on the streets.
</strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;There are many reasons why there is an abundance of stray dogs. One of which is of course what I have emphasized earlier. Abandoned and unwanted pets. Please, don’t have a pet if you won’t take good care of the or have the means to take good care of them. Another is pre-existing strays which often sometimes have offspring which adds up to the stray population. These stray dogs should get an action. It is harmful and unsanitary at the same time. It could result in disease such as rabies, leptospirosis and parasites. This dog contains ticks which also result to lime disease to humans. These dogs could also attack someone because of having no affection, hunger and also trauma. I myself saw someone who has been bitten by a dog. It was painful.
</strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;I am really worried about the current situation of these dogs. I really hope you guys could give solution. Please take action and help these dogs out!! I am looking forward to it.
